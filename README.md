# Data-manipulation-python
is the process of manipulating or changing information to make it more organized and readable. To function correctly, structured data, or the type of information that is only readable by computers, must have a uniform structure. The data must be interpreted and manipulated to be accessible by humans to clean and map it so that it can provide valuable insights. The need for data manipulation becomes even more important with a growing volume of data being used and processed.
